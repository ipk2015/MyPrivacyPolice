Please read this policy carefully before using the App. Your continued use of the App constitutes acceptance of this policy.

#### 2. Types of Information Collected and Purposes
Necessary Permissions and Information

* Location Permission (Geographical Information):
Used to provide weather forecasts for your current city/region.
Note: You may disable this permission in your device settings at any time. Disabling it will prevent automatic local weather updates.

* Network Access Permission:
Required to connect to Huawei Weather API and Amap (Gaode) API for weather data retrieval.

* Our Commitments:
We do not collect permissions or personal information unrelated to weather services (e.g., contacts, photos, SMS).
No non-essential permissions are requested, and all permissions can be revoked via device settings.

#### 3. Data Storage and Processing

* Data Sources:
All weather data is obtained via Huawei Open Platform and Amap (Gaode) Open Platform APIs. We own no meteorological data servers.

* Storage Method:
All weather data is stored locally on your device (e.g., smartphone). We do not retain any information on cloud servers.

* Data Deletion:
When you uninstall the App, all locally stored data will be permanently and irreversibly deleted.

#### 4. Security and Data Sharing
* Security Measures:
Local data is protected by HarmonyOS encryption, and all network requests use HTTPS protocols.

* Third-Party Sharing:
Data is shared only with the following third parties for essential services:
	* Huawei Open Platform API: Receives your general location (e.g., "Haidian District, Beijing") to provide weather data.
